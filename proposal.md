### Tentative Project Title

The 2018 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Men’s
World Cup: Factors that predict the total amount of goals scored by each
participating nation during the tournament

### Motivation

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Men’s World
Cup is an international soccer competition that takes place every 4
years and is contested by 32 national soccer teams of member nations.
The World Cup is one of the most watched sporting events in the world
with tons of money put into sponsoring teams, hosting and betting due to
its popularity across the globe. This year, the tournament will take
place in Qatar between Nov. 20th and Dec. 18.  
The tournament boasts of some of the world’s best soccer athletes and
we’re interested in understanding the factors that predict a team’s
performance on the pitch,the amount of goals scored and/or wins during
the tournament. The more games a team wins increases its chances to win
the entire tournament. With the World Cup taking place in a few weeks,
our project could help share some insight into predicting the nation
that might take perhaps the biggest sports trophy in the world.

### Intended Final Products

The intended final products will include:<br> - A report with
visualizations, exploratory analyses and methods <br> - Webpage &
Screencast

### Anticipated Data Source(s)

- [2018 World Cup
  Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedelnaggar/fifa-worldcup-2018-dataset)
- [2018 GDP
  data](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=GdP&d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3A101%3BcurrID%3AUSD%3BpcFlag%3A1)
- [The Fjelstul World Cup
  Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

Our planned analyses include:<br> - Regression modeling <br> Outcome
variable: Total number of goals scored by each team Predictors: GDP,
population, fifa ranking, etc…<br> Visualizations <br> - Bar plot of GDP
for each country or scatter plot of GDP vs. total goals scored<br> -
Line chart of winning trend in World Cup for each country from 1930 to
2018 <br> - Box plot of number of goals in all past games for each
country <br>

Some coding challenges we may encounter could be problems with small
sample size because the World Cup only has 32 comnpeting countries,
creating interactive plots for our websites and scheduling challenges
and availability to meet and/or code as a group.
